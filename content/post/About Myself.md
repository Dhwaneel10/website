Kem cho guys...

Just a Gujarati entering here. So Hi guys, I'm Dhwaneel Pandya from Mechanical S1. Basically I am interested in Aerospace, I guess that's the reason I joined Mechanical. So, the actual reason of my interests in aerospace in the complexity it holds, it shows me how perfect can things be. Well that's not what I got, I actually come from a Computer Science family, and pretty much get the potential and interests in coding and programming.
