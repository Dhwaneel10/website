1. Got started from the instruction guide on Hugo page.
2. Search for a good theme for the portfolio.
3. Watched a couple of youtube videos to make it more easy.
4. Then clone the theme , and start the basic process to make it.
5. Then creating the content file for the portfolio.
6. After all this gets done, the primary work is over, the main task is to upload this website on github pages.
7. That is a quite a difficult thing but if done step wise, could be a lil easy.
8. So, for that basically, you can once again refer to the hugo pages, coz they do have a instruction manual for everything about hugo sites.
9. Going through Workflow to Github Actions, everyting's explained on it.
10. So, finally with the help of GitHub Action.
And there's the site.....
