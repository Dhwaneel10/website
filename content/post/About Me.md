Kem cho guys…

Just a Gujarati entering here. So Hi guys, I’m Dhwaneel Pandya from Mechanical S1. Basically I am interested in Aerospace, I guess that’s the reason I joined Mechanical. So, the actual reason of my interests in aerospace in the complexity it holds, it shows me how perfect can things be. Well that’s not what I got, I actually come from a Computer Science family, and pretty much get the potential and interests in coding and programming. As a Gujarati individual with a passion for aerospace engineering and coding, my journey at college holds great promise. The field of aerospace engineering has always fascinated me due to its innovative nature and potential to reshape the world we live in. Moreover, my interest in coding enables me to contribute to this field by developing cutting-edge technologies and applications. Through my commitment to these subjects, I hope to make a meaningful impact on society...
